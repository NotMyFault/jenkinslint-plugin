ArtifactCheckerDesc=\
    When setting Jenkins Jobs with Archive Artifact post build you should \
    either set which artifacts or remove this unused publisher phase.<br/> \
    Otherwise the archive artifact phase may not match what you expect.\

ArtifactCheckerSeverity=Medium

CleanupCheckerDesc=\
    There are some builds which demand a lot of disc space. Some builds \
    might run out of space during the build itself and cause build errors. \
    <br/> It's recommended to wipe out those workspaces after building.\

CleanupCheckerSeverity=Medium

GitRefCheckerDesc=\
    When setting Jenkins Jobs with Git SCM you might speed up the cloning time \
    if you use git ref repos when cloning.\

GitRefCheckerSeverity=Low

GitShallowCheckerDesc=\
    When setting Jenkins Jobs with Git SCM Artifact you might speed up the \
    cloning time if you use shallow cloning.\

GitShallowCheckerSeverity=Medium

MultibranchJobTypeCheckerDesc=\
    Polling in Jenkins is inefficient, MultibranchJobProject polls for new branches \
    and also every branch polls for new changes.<br/>It's strongly recommended \
    to use another approach, such as: 1webhooks, Configuration as Code, ...\

MultibranchJobTypeCheckerSeverity=High

NullSCMCheckerDesc=\
    Jenkins works fine with cron/batch tasks, It's strongly recommended to use any \
    SCM tool and therefore to have in that repo whatever script you need to run.\

NullSCMCheckerSeverity=Low

PollingSCMTriggerCheckerDesc=\
    Polling a repository from Jenkins is inefficient; it adds delay on the order \
    of minutes before a build starts after a commit is pushed, and it adds \
    additional loads.<br/> It is much better instead to do push-notification \
    from the repository.\

PollingSCMTriggerCheckerSeverity=High

SlaveDescriptionCheckerSeverity=\
    Jenkins slave description might help you to know what it does and further details.\

SlaveDescriptionCheckerSeverity=Medium

SlaveLabelCheckerDesc=\
    When setting Jenkins Slaves you should set their labels in order to tie those Jobs.\

SlaveLabelCheckerSeverity=Medium

SlaveVersionCheckerSeverityDesc=\
    Jenkins slave description might help you to know what it does and further details.\

SlaveVersionCheckerSeverity=Medium

TimeoutCheckerDesc=\
    There are some builds which might hang forever and cause inaction in the \
    build queue and slaves. It's recommended to control those time based on the \
    <a href=https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build-timeout+Plugin>\
    build timeout plugin</a>.\

TimeoutCheckerSeverity=Medium

WindowsSlaveLaunchCheckerDesc=\
    This launch method relies on DCOM and is often associated with \
    <a href=https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Windows+slaves+fail+to+start+via+DCOM>subtle problems</a>. \
    Consider using Launch slave agents using Java Web Start instead,<br/>which also permits\
    installation as a Windows service but is generally considered more reliable.\
